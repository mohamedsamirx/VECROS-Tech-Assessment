# Multi-Agent Pathfinding and Drone Mission Simulation

This repository contains solutions to two distinct problems: **Multi-Agent Pathfinding in a 3D Grid** and **Drone Simulation and Control**. Both problems showcase practical applications of pathfinding, control algorithms, and visualization techniques in robotics and AI.

## Problem 1: Multi-Agent Pathfinding in a 3D Grid

This problem focuses on finding conflict-free, shortest paths for multiple agents in a 3D grid environment. It employs the **Enhanced Conflict-Based Search (ECBS)** algorithm for multi-agent pathfinding while resolving conflicts dynamically.

### Features
- Computes conflict-free paths for multiple agents.
- Visualizes paths in an interactive 3D plot using Plotly.
- Simulates realistic constraints like grid obstacles and agent velocity.

## Problem 2: Drone Simulation and Control

This problem involves planning and executing a mission for a quadcopter using Dronekit or pymavlink. The mission includes predefined waypoints, dynamic updates, and visualization of the flight path.

### Features
- Generates waypoints with realistic perturbations.
- Dynamically adds waypoints during the mission.
- Visualizes the flight path in 2D using Matplotlib.
